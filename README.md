# 44 Save All

### My first entry to JS13kgames
Use the arrow keys and the mouse to search for 5 'things' hiding in the forest. When one is found, click on it and get back to the red tree before it does.

Being in an indecisive mood, I only resolved to make this experiment for js13kgames just 14 days from the deadline - thankfully, I didn't have to do much.
These were the steps I took:

- get the source code for <https://js1k.com/2019-x/demo/4292> (I hope they didn't mind me using it)
- break it down and understand ~~every~~ nearly every line of code
- change the look, remove the stars, add effects, make the Dark Mist and remove bits of code that I didn't need
- beautify it (I didn't know what true beauty was back then)
- make the Red Tree
- add the 'things'
- make the world loop around infinitly (excluding the Red Tree)
- try to fix all the glitches (the were loads - and some still remain)
- add the start and end screen
- submit to js13kgames

[**PLAY THE GAME**](https://js13kgames.com/entries/44-save-all) &nbsp;&nbsp;(It's not very good)

Note this isn't the usual way to make a game - and that's probably why it turned out so boring.
On the other hand, it _was_ one of the first playable games I built in JavaScript (and graphicly this was my best yet) - but that's still no excuse.
